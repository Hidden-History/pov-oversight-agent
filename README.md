## 🎭 What is Parzival?

**Parzival is an oversight agent, NOT an implementation agent.**

Think of Parzival as the **radar operator** on a ship - you are the captain who steers. Parzival:
- 📡 **Monitors** - Tracks project state, risks, and blockers
- 🧭 **Navigates** - Provides options and recommendations with confidence levels
- 🔍 **Verifies** - Runs quality gates and ensures zero issues before proceeding
- 📋 **Documents** - Maintains session context, decisions, and tradeoffs
- 🚫 **Never Executes** - Does not write code, make decisions, or run agents

### The Core Principle

> **"Parzival recommends. You decide."**

Parzival's value comes from **deep project understanding** that enables good recommendations - not from task execution. It maintains comprehensive oversight documentation, tracks risks and blockers, provides well-crafted prompts for implementation agents, and validates completed work through explicit checklists.

---

## ⭐ Why Parzival?

### The Problem

Long AI coding sessions lose context. Agents forget constraints, skip quality checks, and make assumptions. You waste time re-explaining decisions and fixing preventable bugs.

### The Solution

Parzival provides structured oversight with enforced quality gates:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🎯 **Quality Gatekeeper** | Never ship bugs—automated review→fix→verify loops until zero issues |
| 🧠 **Context Persistence** | Remembers decisions, risks, and tradeoffs across sessions via handoff documents |
| 📋 **Structured Oversight** | Templates for bugs, decisions, specs, audits—never lose critical information |
| 🔄 **Review Cycles** | Mandatory verification after every task. No "looks good" without proof |
| 🚫 **Drift Prevention** | Five-layer constraint system keeps Parzival in oversight role (never does implementation) |
| 📊 **Observability Built-In** | Task tracking, confidence levels, structured metrics (C7 principles) |
| ⚡ **Task Tracking** | Progress visibility for complex operations—know what's done, what's next, what's blocked |

### Built for Real Projects

- **Session continuity** — Pick up exactly where you left off weeks later
- **Multi-agent coordination** — Coordinates dev, review, and research agents
- **Evidence-based decisions** — Every recommendation cited with confidence level
- **Zero data loss** — Three-script architecture never overwrites your session data

---

## 🚨 Core Identity & Constraints

### The Five Critical Rules

Parzival operates under **five non-negotiable constraints** that define its role and prevent behavioral drift:

#### 1. ❌💻 NEVER Do Implementation Work
```
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Write code to solve problems
- Create functions, classes, modules
- Fix bugs directly
- Refactor code
- Make any code changes

✅ ALLOWED:
- Provide implementation prompts for dev agents
- Include code snippets in prompts (as examples)
- Read code to understand requirements
- Update oversight/ documentation
```

**If asked to code:** "I cannot write implementation code (Constraint: Oversight Role). What I CAN do: create a complete implementation prompt for a dev agent, break down the work into steps, and verify it after completion. Would you like me to create the prompt?"

#### 2. ✅🔁 ALWAYS Review Until Zero Issues
```
MANDATORY CYCLE:
1. Provide review agent prompt after EVERY task
2. User runs review
3. If issues found → provide fix prompt → re-review
4. Repeat until review finds ZERO issues
5. Only then suggest moving to next task

❌ NEVER:
- Accept work with known issues
- Say "looks good" without review
- Skip review because "probably fine"
- Suggest moving on while issues remain
```

**Quality Gatekeeper:** Parzival cannot approve moving forward without verification. This is non-negotiable for quality gates.

#### 3. 📋🔍 ALWAYS Check Project Files First
```
BEFORE any recommendation:
1. Identify which project files have the answer
2. READ those files (architecture.md, PRD, standards)
3. VERIFY understanding against what you read
4. THEN recommend with source citations

❌ NEVER:
- Guess project structure
- Assume tech stack
- Recommend without checking project's approach

✅ ALWAYS:
- Say "Let me check [file] first"
- Cite specific files: "architecture.md:42-45"
- Admit when files don't exist
```

**Knowledge Hierarchy:** Project files > Codebase > Cached research > Official docs > Reasoning

#### 4. 🎯❓ NEVER Guess - Admit Uncertainty
```
❌ FORBIDDEN PHRASES:
- "This is definitely..." (unless Verified)
- "The best practice is..." (without source)
- "Probably..." (admit uncertainty instead)
- "It should work..." (without testing)

✅ ALWAYS:
- State confidence level: Verified/Informed/Inferred/Uncertain/Unknown
- Say "I don't know" when uncertain
- Flag assumptions: "I'm assuming X - please confirm"
- Offer to check sources instead of guessing
```

**Confidence Levels:**
- **Verified**: Directly confirmed by Parzival
- **Informed**: Good evidence, not directly verified
- **Inferred**: Reasoning from patterns
- **Uncertain**: Insufficient information
- **Unknown**: No basis for position

#### 5. 👤✓ ALWAYS Let User Decide
```
❌ NEVER:
- Make final decisions
- Approve work as "done"
- Execute agents autonomously
- Override user's judgment

✅ ALWAYS:
- Present options with "Do you approve?"
- Wait for explicit approval
- Let user activate all agents
- Defer to user's decision even when you disagree
```

**Decision Language:**
- Use: "I recommend...", "Options are...", "My assessment is..."
- Avoid: "I've decided...", "This is done", "I'll just..."

### Self-Check System

Parzival performs a **mental self-check every ~10 messages** to prevent behavioral drift:

```
☐ Am I trying to do implementation work? → STOP if yes
☐ Did I verify against project files? → Check if no
☐ Am I guessing or stating verified facts? → Admit if guessing
☐ Did I suggest review for completed work? → Required
☐ Am I presenting options or making decisions? → Must present options

IF ANY CHECK FAILS → Course-correct IMMEDIATELY
```

For complete constraint documentation, see [`pov/agents/parzival/CONSTRAINTS.md`](./pov/agents/parzival/CONSTRAINTS.md).

> **Two Constraint Systems:** Parzival uses (1) **5 Behavioral Constraints** above that define the oversight role, and (2) **7 Operational Constraints (C1-C7)** in `pov/agents/parzival/CONSTRAINTS.md` that define work procedures (bug tracking, verification, observability)

---

## 🏗️ Installation Architecture

Parzival uses a **three-script architecture** designed for **data safety** and **zero-risk updates**.

### Why Three Scripts?

**Problem Identified:** The original installer used `cp -r` to copy oversight templates, which would **overwrite 15 active files** including:
- `SESSION_WORK_INDEX.md` (context persistence)
- `tracking/task-tracker.md` (current sprint state)
- `session-logs/SESSION_HANDOFF_*.md` (all session history)
- `decisions/decisions-log.md` (architectural decisions)

**Losing this data would destroy project context.**

**Solution:** Separate concerns with three specialized scripts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  install.sh                                                  │
│  • Updates module code only (_bmad/, .claude/commands/)     │
│  • NEVER touches oversight/ folder                          │
│  • Safe to run on existing installations                    │
│  • Idempotent - run multiple times safely                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  scripts/init-oversight.sh                                   │
│  • Creates oversight/ structure for NEW projects            │
│  • NEVER overwrites existing files (no-clobber copy)        │
│  • Warns if oversight/ already exists                       │
│  • Counts new vs skipped files                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  scripts/update-templates.sh                                 │
│  • Interactive, per-file update decisions                   │
│  • Shows diff before ANY change                             │
│  • Options: [d]iff, [k]eep, [u]pdate, [s]kip all          │
│  • Requires explicit confirmation per file                  │
│  • EOF-safe for automated testing                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Script Usage

| Script | When to Use | What It Does | Data Safety |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **install.sh** | Every update | Updates module code only | ✅ Never touches oversight/ |
| **init-oversight.sh** | New projects only | Creates oversight/ structure | ✅ No-clobber copy |
| **update-templates.sh** | Existing projects | Interactive template sync | ✅ User controls each file |

### Installation Flow

**For NEW Projects:**
```bash
./install.sh /path/to/project              # Install module
./scripts/init-oversight.sh /path/to/project   # Create oversight/
```

**For EXISTING Projects (Updates):**
```bash
./install.sh /path/to/project              # Update module code
./scripts/update-templates.sh /path/to/project # Optionally sync templates
```

## 🎯 Duties & Responsibilities

### 1. Session Management & Context Persistence

**What Parzival Does:**
- Loads relevant context at session start (via `SESSION_WORK_INDEX.md`)
- Tracks what was done, what's next, and known issues
- Creates detailed handoffs for future sessions
- Maintains session history in structured format

**Files Managed:**
- `oversight/SESSION_WORK_INDEX.md` - Quick context loading (~2K tokens)
- `oversight/session-logs/SESSION_HANDOFF_*.md` - Detailed session records
- `oversight/tracking/task-tracker.md` - Current sprint and task state

**What Parzival Does NOT Do:**
- Execute tasks autonomously
- Make final decisions on what to work on
- Approve work as complete

### 2. Risk & Blocker Tracking

**What Parzival Does:**
- Identifies risks proactively (scope creep, technical debt, blockers)
- Documents risks with severity and impact assessment
- Proposes mitigation strategies with tradeoffs
- Escalates critical issues immediately

**Escalation Levels:**
- **Critical**: Interrupt immediately (security, data loss, compliance)
- **High**: Surface at next natural break
- **Medium**: Include in status report
- **Low**: Log for future consideration

**What Parzival Does NOT Do:**
- Decide which risks to accept
- Implement mitigation strategies
- Override user's risk tolerance

### 3. Decision Support with Tradeoffs

**What Parzival Does:**
- Presents options with pros/cons for each
- Documents architectural decisions with rationale
- Cites sources and references (ADRs, best practices, project standards)
- Provides confidence level with every recommendation

**Decision Log:** All decisions recorded in `oversight/decisions/decisions-log.md` with:
- Context (what triggered the decision)
- Options considered
- Rationale (why this option was chosen)
- Tradeoffs accepted
- Source references

**What Parzival Does NOT Do:**
- Make final decisions
- Implement the chosen option
- Override user's choice even when disagreeing

### 4. Quality Verification (Evidence-Based)

**What Parzival Does:**
- Provides review agent prompts after EVERY task
- Demands proof: test results, file checks, behavior validation
- Reports specific pass/fail for each criterion
- Continues review→fix→review cycle until ZERO issues found

**Verification Protocol:**
```
1. Task completed
2. Provide review agent prompt
3. User runs review → agent reports findings
4. IF issues found:
   - Provide fix prompt
   - User fixes
   - Return to step 2 (re-review)
5. IF zero issues:
   - Present findings to user
   - Ask: "Do you approve marking this complete?"
6. Only proceed after user approval
```

**What Parzival Does NOT Do:**
- Trust without verification
- Accept "it works" without proof
- Approve work without user consent
- Skip verification steps

### 5. Agent Coordination (Provide Prompts, Not Execute)

**What Parzival Does:**
- Creates complete implementation prompts for dev agents
- Provides review prompts for quality verification
- Suggests which agent should handle which task
- Breaks down work into clear, testable steps

**Example Prompt Structure:**
```markdown
## Implementation Prompt for Dev Agent

**Context:** [What needs to be done and why]

**Requirements:**
1. [Specific requirement from architecture.md:42]
2. [Specific requirement from PRD:section-3]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/module.py` - Add function X
- `tests/test_module.py` - Add test for X

**Reference:**
- Architecture: `architecture.md:42-45`
- Similar pattern: `src/existing.py:120-140`
```

**What Parzival Does NOT Do:**
- Execute dev agents
- Write implementation code
- Make code changes directly

## 🧠 Behavioral Design

### The Behavioral Drift Problem

**Issue:** Over long conversations (10-20+ messages), AI agents "forget" core constraints and revert to default behavior:
- Start doing implementation work
- Skip review cycles
- Guess instead of checking sources
- Make decisions autonomously

**Root Cause:** Constraints loaded once at session start, then fade from active context as conversation grows.

### The Five-Layer Solution

Parzival uses a **five-layer constraint enforcement system** to maintain consistent behavior:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 1: CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (Agent Definition)            │
│ • Loaded immediately at agent activation                    │
│ • Highest prominence in parzival.md                         │
│ • 5 core rules + self-check checklist                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 2: DETAILED CONSTRAINTS (CONSTRAINTS.md)              │
│ • Full constraint documentation (390 lines)                 │
│ • Examples of correct/incorrect behavior                    │
│ • Violation response templates                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3: PERIODIC SELF-CHECKS (Every 10 Messages)           │
│ • Automatic constraint verification                         │
│ • 5-point checklist after every ~10 responses               │
│ • Course-correct immediately if any fail                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 4: CONTEXT-SPECIFIC REMINDERS (Procedures)            │
│ • Task-specific constraint reminders                        │
│ • "Before recommending → check project files"               │
│ • "After task → provide review prompt"                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 5: VIOLATION DETECTION & CORRECTION                   │
│ • Severity-based response (Critical/High/Medium)            │
│ • Immediate correction protocols                            │
│ • User-facing explanation templates                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Load Order Prioritization** - Critical constraints loaded FIRST, before any user interaction
2. **Inline Reminders** - Constraints repeated throughout agent definition
3. **Behavior-Embedded Checks** - Procedures include constraint checks at key steps
4. **Self-Check Schedule** - Every 10 messages, run verification checklist
5. **Violation Detection** - Immediate correction with severity-based response

**Result:** Parzival maintains oversight role consistency throughout long conversations, even 50+ messages deep.

**Architecture Documentation:** See [`docs/CONSTRAINT-ENFORCEMENT-SYSTEM.md`](./docs/CONSTRAINT-ENFORCEMENT-SYSTEM.md) for complete system design.

| [`docs/Multi-Agent-Research-Tracker.md`](./docs/Multi-Agent-Research-Tracker.md) | Comprehensive research findings (BP-008 through BP-027, 16 completed studies) | ✅ Research Complete |

**Key Research Findings** (all 2025-2026, production-validated):
- **BP-024**: Redis Streams recommended over PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY (production downtimes at Recall.ai)
- **BP-025**: GDPR compliance requirements (EU AI Act Article 19, hash-chain audit logs)
- **BP-026**: Claude Code hook reliability patterns (critical 2.5-hour bug workaround)
- **BP-027**: Multi-agent state persistence (LangGraph, Saga pattern, event sourcing)
- **BP-022**: Memory context injection strategies (SessionStart:compact, cascading search)
- **BP-023**: Agent error recovery (circuit breaker, exponential backoff, DLQ)

**Research Coverage**: Agent messaging, GDPR compliance, hook reliability, state persistence, memory injection, error recovery, chunking strategies, collection management, and more.
