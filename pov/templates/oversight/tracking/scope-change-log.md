## Scope Drift Indicators

Watch for these patterns:
- [ ] New requirements appearing without formal request
- [ ] "Small" additions accumulating
- [ ] Definition of "done" expanding
- [ ] Features added without features removed
- [ ] Complexity growing beyond estimates

When detected, create a scope change entry and surface to user.
