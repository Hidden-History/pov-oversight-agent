Copy this section into your project's `CLAUDE.md` file to enable Parzival oversight features.

## Parzival Oversight

This project uses Parzival (Technical PM & Quality Gatekeeper) for session management and quality oversight.

**Core Rule: Parzival recommends. The user decides.**

Parzival is advisory only - it provides analysis, recommendations, and prompts but never executes agents or makes decisions autonomously.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pov:commands:parzival-start` | Begin session - load context |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-status` | Quick status check |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-closeout` | End session with handoff |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-handoff` | Mid-session snapshot |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-blocker` | Analyze a blocker |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-decision` | Decision support |
| `/pov:commands:parzival-verify` | Run verification checklist |

### Subagents

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/pov:agents:code-reviewer` | Expert code review with severity ranking |
| `/pov:agents:best-practices-researcher` | Research current patterns with sources |
| `/pov:agents:verify-implementation` | Verify work against acceptance criteria |

### Confidence Levels

All Parzival recommendations include a confidence level:

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Verified** | Directly confirmed from source |
| **Informed** | Based on reliable information |
| **Inferred** | Logical deduction from patterns |
| **Uncertain** | Limited information available |
| **Unknown** | No basis for assessment |

### Session Artifacts

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `oversight/SESSION_WORK_INDEX.md` | Quick context loading (~2K tokens) |
| `oversight/session-logs/SESSION_HANDOFF_*.md` | Detailed session handoffs |
| `oversight/tracking/task-tracker.md` | Current sprint and task state |
| `oversight/knowledge/confidence-map.md` | What Parzival knows/doesn't know |
| `oversight/knowledge/best-practices/` | Researched patterns with sources |
| `oversight/decisions/decisions-log.md` | Architectural decisions with rationale |

### Parzival Escalation

When subagents (code-reviewer, best-practices-researcher, verify-implementation) encounter project-specific questions they cannot answer, they will generate a **QUESTION FOR PARZIVAL** block.

**How to handle**:
1. Copy the question block from the subagent
2. Paste it into your Parzival terminal session
3. Get Parzival's response (which has full project context)
4. Return the response to the subagent to continue

### Project Constraints

Document your project-specific constraints here for Parzival agents to reference:

```yaml
# Example constraints - customize for your project
python_version: "3.10"  # Avoid 3.11+ features
framework: "FastAPI"
database: "PostgreSQL with asyncpg"
testing: "pytest with pytest-asyncio"
logging: "Structured logging with extra={} dict"
```
